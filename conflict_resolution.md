For guidance, we have included our intent in some sections template code and have provided PRAGMA's example for each section. Please adjust accordingly
to best work for your project. 

< begin >
##

## Context
<!-- Provide context, explain where the decision came from. -->
{your project} currently lacks an incident resolution process. While individual contributors and maintainer committees may handle issues as they arise, 
there is no formalized structure to ensure consistency, transparency, and efficiency in addressing incidents. The absence of a clear process can 
lead to delays in resolution, miscommunication and an inconsistent approach to similar issues.

## Motivation
<!-- Why it's necessary to make that decision. -->
A well-defined incident resolution process can aid in ensuring the stability and reliability of {your project}. By formalizing an incident resolution 
process, {your project} will benefit from a structured approach to handling issues, improving response times and fostering a culture of 
accountability and of continuous learning.

## Decision
<!-- Clarify the content of the decision by explaining its scope of application with sufficient details to be self-explanatory. -->
{your project} will implement the following structured Incident Resolution Process:

## Incident Resolution Process

## How to submit a report

If you believe someone is in immediate physical danger, please call your local emergency number.

You may report a potential violation of the {your project} Code of Conduct in writing or in a spoken conversation as indicated below.

### Submit in writing

To report a violation in writing, please email {specify the address and who receives email at that address}. If you do not want your 
report to be received by all members {please specify an alternative such as contacting an individual in a leadership role}

### Submit in spoken conversation

If you prefer to report the violation in a spoken conversation, you may request a telephone conversation or virtual meeting with 
{specify how this will work}.

### How to report anonymously

If you desire to submit a report anonymously, please send a message directly to any individual member of {your project} and let them 
know you would like to submit a Code of Conduct report anonymously. 

## What information to include in your report

When reporting a potential Code of Conduct violation, please include the following information in your report:

- Names of the people involved (or if names are unknown, use descriptions and any identifying information such as appearance, role,
- username, or handle), including the person whom you believe violated the Code of Conduct and any witnesses.
- Description of the incident, including the events that occurred, the date and time, and location or community space where the
- incident occurred.
- The portion(s) of the CoC you believe to be violated.
- If you have relevant documentary evidence, such as screenshots or photographs, please provide those with your report.

## What happens after a report is submitted

### Acknowledgement of Receipt

The {appropriate member(s)} will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within a few business days.

### Who will have access to reports

Reports will only be shared with non-conflicted members {appropriate member(s)}, with very limited exceptions. See the 
“Confidentiality,” “Information Sharing,” “Communicating the Results,” and “Conflicts of Interest” sections below for more information.

### Investigation

The {appropriate member(s)} will investigate the report by reviewing available evidence and, if appropriate, interviewing witnesses, the 
accused person, and persons who were targeted or may have been harmed. In some cases, the {appropriate member(s)} may engage an external 
professional investigator or mediator to assist.

If a potential incident comes to the {appropriate member(s)}’s attention that may present a serious continuing risk to community safety, 
the {appropriate member(s)} may investigate even if no official report has been received.

If the {appropriate member(s)} determines that the Code of Conduct was violated, the {appropriate member(s)} will decide on what remediation 
steps should be taken. See “Resolution” below for more information.

### Notification to the Accused Person

During or after the investigation, the {appropriate member(s)} shall notify the accused person that an incident report has been received 
concerning their alleged behavior, unless the {appropriate member(s)} determines that the report is meritless or has been filed in bad 
faith.

### Resolution

#### Interim Protective Measures

Although the {appropriate member(s)} will not take any permanent actions until the {appropriate member(s)} has gathered and reviewed all 
available evidence, the {appropriate member(s)} reserves the right to take immediate temporary action (e.g., temporarily suspending 
someone’s participation in a community space while the investigation is pending) at any time after learning of the incident if the 
{appropriate member(s)} determines this is necessary to protect the community or community members from the risk of harm.

#### Mediation and Resolution by Agreement

If the accused person and the parties potentially harmed in an incident communicate to the {appropriate member(s)} that they would like to 
resolve the incident through restorative conversation, mediation, or mutual agreement, the {appropriate member(s)} will wait until the 
parties have attempted to do so before making any final decisions regarding resolution of the incident.

#### Potential Remedies

The goal of Code of Conduct incident resolution is to support and safeguard the health, safety, and well-being of the community and 
individuals who participate in the community, and to reinforce community standards for acceptable behavior.

- **Restorative Justice**: Focuses on repairing harm and providing support for all parties involved.
- **Transformative Justice**: Addresses systemic issues that may have contributed to or encouraged harmful behavior.

#### Examples of Remedies

- Issuing a warning
- Removing harmful content from community or project spaces
- A public or private apology
- Temporary suspension or permanent ban from community or project
- Temporary or permanent removal from a leadership role
- Education, mentoring, or coaching
- Addressing systemic issues that contributed to harmful behavior

## Accountability

If any party does not fulfill their obligations related to resolution of the incident, the {appropriate member(s)} may take further action to resolve the incident.

## Communicating the Results

An incident is considered “resolved” when the {appropriate member(s)} has completed its investigation and determined the necessary 
remediation actions. The {appropriate member(s)} will determine how much information to share with the reporter and the accused person, 
considering privacy and confidentiality concerns.

## Information Sharing

The {appropriate member(s)} of {your project} may share information with each other on an as-needed basis about 
reported incidents and their resolution for limited purposes.

## Confidentiality Policy

Only members of {your project} without conflicts of interest will have access to confidential information 
pertaining to the incident. They will not disclose confidential information without permission unless legally required.

## No Retaliation

The {your project} community will not tolerate retaliation against community members who report concerns under the CoC in good faith, 
or who assist in an investigation.

## Conflicts of Interest

### Hard Conflicts

An {appropriate member(s)} member has a hard conflict of interest if:

- They are the accused person or a person alleged to be directly harmed.
- They have a close personal or professional relationship with the accused or affected individuals.
- They have another personal interest likely to undermine impartiality.

### Soft Conflicts

A soft conflict exists when:

- The member works at the same company as the accused person but does not have a close relationship.
- Other circumstances give the appearance of a conflict of interest.

## Amendments

Any amendments to these Incident Resolution Procedures must be approved by the {appropriate member(s)}.
