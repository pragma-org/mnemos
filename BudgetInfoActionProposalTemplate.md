#### Abstract <br>
_What is your proposal and how does it benefit Cardano, a summary._

#### Motivation
## Who we are
_Describe the project and makeup of the project team._ <br>
_List the members (GitHub/relevant link) and one-line their responsibilities._ <br>
_- Name: responsible for ie. the consensus and simulation testing._
 
## Why... your project?
_A short list of well phrased reasons to support the value of your project. Ideas to get you thinking:_

Our project addresses the following key areas: 
1. Resource efficiency: <br>
_Be concise, a one-line justification, ideally backed by a metric, fact, or precedent._ <br>
2. Alignment with industry trends: <br>
_Be concise, a one-line justification, ideally backed by a metric, fact, or precedent._ <br>
3. Community alignment: <br>
_Be concise, a one-line justification, ideally backed by a metric, fact, or precedent._ <br>
4. Additional benefits: <br>
_Be concise, a one-line justification, ideally backed by a metric, fact, or precedent._ <br>

#### Rationale
## Executive summary (of costs)
_A successful proposal recently illustrated the costs in simple breakdowns:_
- Full Time Employee’s annual costs
- A chart, reflecting each scope of the project and how many FTE’s
- Independent auditors should be mentioned here
- A 25% treasury-refundable contingency was included
- A final number highlighted the total amount and duration of the project
  
## Administration of the budget
> _Per the requirement: “Budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals, including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight.”_

_In this section, explain how your budget will be administered, including the roles and responsibilities and any oversight mechanisms you plan to implement._ <br>
_You should address:_
- How funds will be safeguarded (including use of smart contracts, multisig wallets, or legal frameworks)
- Remuneration of vendors, contributors and independent auditors
- Under what conditions and how would funds be returned to the treasury
- How decisions will be made and recorded for scope changes, fund reallocation, or credential updates
- Define the dispute resolution process
  
_Smart contracts are strongly preferred as a mechanism to enforce transparency and accountability. If used, describe the capabilities. For example:_

Our smart contract will enforce fund disbursement according to defined scopes and permissions. The following capabilities are anticipated:
- Standard withdrawal: A scope owner may request a withdrawal, subject to approval by other scope owners.
- Contingency withdrawal: Emergency funds may be accessed from a shared contingency pool, subject to approval by other scope owners.
- Scope reconciliation: Budget or scope ownership may be reassigned through consensus of designated scope owners.
- Contingency refund/closure: Unused contingency funds will be returned to the treasury.
- Credential rotation: In the event of lost access or contributor departure, a defined process allows secure transfer of control.
- Failsafe: If access is irrecoverably lost, remaining funds are returned automatically to the treasury via a failsafe clause. <br>

_Additionally, if your project relies on an existing governance or legal framework (e.g., PRAGMA’s Maintainer Committee Framework), link to or briefly summarize its relevance. Reference them externally (ie link to a document on IPFS or GitHub) and keep them managed “off-chain” and outside the proposal’s modifiable scope._

## Reporting
### Regular reporting
_Oversight metrics are required so we recommend a reporting section. Specify the frequency and location the reporting can be found, then detail what the reporting will include._

### Regular proof of work
_Consider a recurring public check-in to showcase your project’s progress, whether it is technical, operational, or community-focused. This could look like software demos, AMA sessions on Twitter or YouTube or a series of blog posts._

## Constitutionality checklist
_A simple checklist of the points covered from the Cardano Constitution. Self assess, ensuring each is covered. Avoid modifying to cite specific threshold figures that could change within the lifespan of your proposal. Include something like this in your proposal:_
### Purpose
- This proposal is for work intended to … 
### Article III.5: the process of on-chain governance
- We have submitted this proposal in a standardized, legible format, which includes a URL and hash of all documented off-chain content. We believe our rationale to be detailed and sufficient. The proposal contains a title, abstract, reason for the proposal and relevant supporting materials.
### Article IV.1: proposing budgets
- This proposal accords with the provisions of this article as it is intended to cover the maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain.
- This proposal covers a shorter period than 73 epochs, which is permitted in this section of the Constitution, to match the Net-Change Limit period.
### Article IV.2: funds administration
- This proposal specifies an administrator in accordance with this provision.
- This proposal specifies a process for the administrator to oversee the use of funds,meeting the requirements of this clause.
### Article IV.3: Net-Change Limit
- This proposal and the treasury withdrawals it would enable do not violate the currently agreed upon Net-Change Limit.
### Article IV.4: Auditor
- This proposal makes provisions for an auditor.
### Guardrails
This proposal is subject to TREASURY-04a in that it defines a Cardano blockchain ecosystem budget. It requires a threshold greater than 50% of the DReps' active voting stake to be considered approved and enable subsequent withdrawals pertaining to this budget.

## Conclusion
_Use this final section to clearly state the long-term value your project brings to the Cardano ecosystem. Reinforce your team’s ability to deliver with transparency and thoughtful governance. Be candid about assumptions, the timelines, and the risks, then show how your team is prepared to manage that. Emphasize the tangible benefits to the ecosystem and the measurable impact the community can expect in return for its investment. Your conclusion should leave the feeling that funding your project is both a responsible and forward-looking choice for Cardano._
